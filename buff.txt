first you start at the 0th string in the array, you set the minimum length to the 0th element
then, you start to iterate through the array, checking whether the ith element is longer than the minimum length
if the ith element is longer than the minimum length, you set the minimum and maximum length to the current length and you repeat steps 1-3 until you're at the end of the array
